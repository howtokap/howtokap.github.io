title: "ESP32 Thing Reboot"

Late last year I bought an ESP32 Thing from Sparkfun.  At the time I
was able to build the toolchain and run a blinker app.  But then I set
it aside.  Now I'm making another run at it, hoping to interface it to
the Hillcrest BNO080.

First, I had to relearn the build process:
* export IDF_PATH=~/esp/esp32-idf
* make menuconfig
* make

Downloading seems to work like this:
* Hold button 1 down.
* Press and release reset button.
* make flash (initiates download process)
* Once connection established, release button 1.

Releasing button 1 too soon in the process seems to either exit the
bootloader or put it in a state where the host can't connect.  So
that's key.

Coming soon:
GPIO setup and I2C programming.
