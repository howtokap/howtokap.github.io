title: "How To KAP Reboot"
date: 2016-11-21

I'm in the process of reviving my howtokap.com site here on Github.
This account, howtokap, was created to host the software of my R/C
Arduino controller.  And recently I've been learning how to use Github
Pages and Jekyll.  It seems likely I can restore the web pages
previously hosted on howtokap.com here.

I also have some new projects to work on: New KAP rig frames designed
with OpenSCAD and/or SolidPython, a new brushless DC motor driver, new
radio control modules based on the ESP32, new platform stabilization
with the BNO080.  Lots of stuff.  And with Thanksgiving just a couple
days away, the winter build season is ready to begin.

This blog and site are absolutely bare bones at the moment.  I'll need
to set up a theme and learn more about Jekyll to pretty it up.
