I spent some time with the Jekyll code for this site.  I added a page
header, added the "Tutorial" item to the Nav bar, and put the text of
the first two pages of the tutorial online.

There are many more pages I can rescue from my Evernote notes.

Still need to:
* Add a menu to the left side.
* Review text of new pages.
* Add the images that were never in the original site.
* Add new pages.
